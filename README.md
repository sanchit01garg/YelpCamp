# YelpCamp
This a functioning website that stores campground records. It allows the user to create, read, update and delete campgorunds if they have authorised themselves.
Moreover, users can leave a review on any camping site. 
Each campground webpage has its own map pinned to its location. Further, the index page has a cluster map depicting the locations of all the maps.
