# YelpCamp
This a functioning website that stores campground records. I have implemented full CRUD functionality for campgrounds and reviews.
I have also implemented authentication using passport. 
Each campground webpage has its own map pinned to its location. Further, the index page has a cluster map depicting the locations of all the maps.

You can see the deployed version here: https://obscure-island-52050.herokuapp.com/
